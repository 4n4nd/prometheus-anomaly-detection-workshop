    "# Prometheus Anomaly Detection\n",
    "This notebook will give an introduction to how we can perform anomaly detection for Prometheus metrics using a machine learning time series forecasting model. Before we dive into the data science work, let's understand the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding the Problem\n",
    "Prometheus is the chosen application to do monitoring across multiple products and platforms. Prometheus metrics are time series data identified by metric name and key/value pairs. With the increased amount of metrics flowing in it is getting harder to see the signals within the noise. The current state of the art is to graph out metrics on dashboards and alert on thresholds. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, we can leverage machine learning algorithms to perform time series forecasting and predict an unusual behavior or pattern in the metrics. The predicted values from the model can be compared with the actual metric values and if they differ from the default threshold values, we can flag it as an **anomaly**. Before we start looking at any machine learning model, let's try to understand the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding the Data\n",
    "As we saw in the previous Prometheus API client notebook, Prometheus metrics are time series data identified by:\n",
    "* **metric name**\n",
    "* **labels**\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the Prometheus UI and see for yourself what the metrics look like!\n",
    "\n",
    "Any given combination of labels for the same metric name identifies a particular dimensional instantiation of that metric. Each metric consists of a timestamp and its corresponding value at that timestamp. Prometheus comprises of four metric types:\n",
    "* **Counter**\n",
    "* **Gauge**\n",
    "* **Histogram**\n",
    "* **Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find more details about these metrics here: https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will walk through some of the essential steps required for training a machine learning model to predict anomalies on a sample Prometheus time series metrics data set:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Preparation & Data Exploration\n",
    "Bad data or poor quality of data can alter the accuracy of insights or could lead to incorrect insights, which is why data preparation or data cleaning is of utmost importance even though it is one of the time consuming tasks of the data science process. Some of the tasks in our data pre-processing are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Load sample metric data set (Json)\n",
    "* Convert the raw metric data into suitable pandas dataframe using the Prometheus API client\n",
    "* Compress the timeseries into suitable (1h/ 0.5h/ 0.25/) frequency for training the model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Data\n",
    "This is when the real fun starts. Machine learning algorithms can help you go a step further into getting insights and predicting future trends. Once again, before reaching this stage, bear in mind that the scrubbing and exploring stage are equally crucial to building useful models. So take your time on those stages instead of jumping right to this process. During this stage we will:\n",
    "* Train a ML model\n",
    "* Forecast the predictions on a test data set\n",
    "* Evaluate the predictions for detecting anomalies"

    "## Model Data\n",
    "We are now ready to train a time seriers forecasting model. Here, we will train the SARIMA model i.e. Seasonal Auto-Regressive Moving Average model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is SARIMA?\n",
    "Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, or ARIMA, is one of the most widely used forecasting methods for univariate time series data forecasting. Although this method can handle data with a trend, it does not support time series with a seasonal component i.e. time series with a repeating cycle. An extension to ARIMA that supports the direct modeling of the seasonal component of the series is called SARIMA.\n",
    "\n",
    "SARIMA adds three new hyperparameters to specify the autoregression (AR), differencing (I) and moving average (MA) for the seasonal component of the series, as well as an additional parameter for the period of the seasonality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are hyperparameters?\n",
    "They are simply the very \"knobs\" one \"turns\" when building/tuning a statistical learning model. A model hyperparameter is a configuration that is external to the model and whose value cannot be estimated from data. These hyperparametrs effect the speed and quality of the model training process. Different model training algorithms require different hyperparameters, some simple algorithms (such as ordinary least squares regression) require none. Given these hyperparameters, the training algorithm learns the parameters from the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "We cannot know the best value for a model hyperparameter on a given problem. We may use rules of thumb, copy values used on other problems, or search for the best value by trial and error.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a machine learning algorithm is tuned for a specific problem, then you are tuning the hyperparameters of the model or order to discover the parameters of the model that result in the most skillful predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to configure SARIMA?\n",
    "Configuring a SARIMA requires selecting hyperparameters for both the trend and seasonal elements of the series. There are three **trend** elements that require configuration. These are the ones that are configured in the standard ARIMA model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **p** - Trend autoregression order (AR part)\n",
    "\n",
    " - *It allows to incorporate the effect of past values into our model. Intuitively, this would be similar to stating that it is likely to be warm tomorrow if it has been warm the past 3 days.*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **d** - Trend difference order (I part)\n",
    "\n",
    " - *It is the number of nonseasonal differences needed for stationarity. Intuitively, this would be similar to stating that it is likely to be same temperature tomorrow if the difference in temperature in the last three days has been very small.*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **q** - Trend moving average order (MA part)\n",
    "\n",
    " - *It is the number of lagged forecast errors in the prediction equation. This allows us to set the error of our model as a linear combination of the error values observed at previous time points in the past.*\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four **seasonal** elements that are not part of ARIMA that must be configured; they are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **P**: Seasonal autoregressive order.\n",
    "* **D**: Seasonal difference order.\n",
    "* **Q**: Seasonal moving average order.\n",
    "* **m**: The number of time steps for a single seasonal period.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Seasonal portion `(P, D, Q)m` has the same structure as the non-seasonal parts. It may — but does not have to include — an AR factor, an MA factor, and/or an I factor. In this part of the model, all of these factors operate across the number of period `(m)` in your season. This seasonality is a regular pattern of changes that repeats over `m` time periods. E.g. If there is a seasonal factor of 3 over a time series of monthly data, the pattern repeats every quarter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put these all together and you get a `SARIMA (p, d, q) x (P, D, Q)m` which is what we’re looking to build.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exact model we’ll be using from the python package `statsmodels` is the `SARIMAX`, where `X` is the use of an exogenous explanatory variable (the X part of SARIMAX). We’re not going to get into adding exogenous variables to our model, so you can ignore this for now. The default will be `none` when we run the model as we don't have any extra variable to include at the moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, the notation for a SARIMA model is specified as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SARIMAX(order=(p,d,q), seasonal_order=(P,D,Q,m))\n",
    "```\n",
    "Source: http://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.tsa.statespace.sarimax.SARIMAX.html\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding the hyperparameters\n",
    "In order to find the most optimized hyperparameters for the model and the given dataset, we carried out a Grid search method. Grid-searching is the process of scanning the data to configure optimal parameters for a given model. It is important to note that Grid-searching can be extremely computationally expensive and may take your machine quite a long time to run. Grid-Search will build a model on each parameter combination possible. It iterates through every parameter combination and stores a model for each combination. We then choose the model/hyperparameters which resulted in the best accuracy or low error rates. \n",
    "\n",
    "A good explanation of how this is done can be found here: https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-grid-search-sarima-model-hyperparameters-for-time-series-forecasting-in-python/\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence to save time and make things easier for you, we have already identified the optimized parameter values required to train the SARIMA model for this particular dataset. The values were found to be:\n",
    "* **p** = 1\n",
    "* **d** = 2\n",
    "* **q** = 2\n",
    "* **P** = 2\n",
    "* **D** = 2\n",
    "* **Q** = 2"

    "Now, we need to identify the relvant value for `m` which indicates the seasonality order for our data. Seasonality is the presence of any predictable fluctuation or pattern that recurs/repeats over regular intervals. For example, data with daily observations might have a weekly seasonality (frequency=7) or an annual seasonality (frequency=365.25). Similarly, data that are observed every minute might have an hourly seasonality (frequency=60), a daily seasonality (frequency=24x60=1440), a weekly seasonality (frequency=24x60x7=10080) and an annual seasonality (frequency=24x60x365.25=525960).\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw data obtained from Prometheus for the disk write metric was observed every minute and had a **daily** seasonality. So, depending on how you resample your data i.e. whether it is hourly,minutely,daily etc we can determine the corresponding daily seasonality order. For example, if the data is sampled to be `hourly` then `m = 24 (i.e. 1 day = 24 hours)`. \n",

    "### Interpretting the Model Forecast\n",
    "#### Residuals\n",
    "The “residuals” in a time series model are what is left over after fitting a model. For many (but not all) time series models, the residuals are equal to the difference between the observations and the corresponding fitted values. Residuals are useful in checking whether a model has adequately captured the information in the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, when exploring residual errors we are looking for patterns or structure. A sign of a pattern suggests that the errors are not random.\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect the residual errors to be random, because it means that the model has captured all of the structure and the only error left is the random fluctuations in the time series that cannot be modeled.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sign of a pattern or structure suggests that there is more information that a model could capture and use to make better predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Residual Summary Statistics\n",
    "We can also calculate summary statistics on the residual errors to understand their distribution. This includes the mean and standard deviation of the distribution, as well as percentiles and the minimum and maximum errors observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Primarily, we are interested in the mean value of the residual errors. A value close to zero suggests no bias in the forecasts, whereas positive and negative values suggest a positive or negative bias in the forecasts made. It is useful to know about a bias in the forecasts as it can be directly corrected in forecasts prior to their use or evaluation. Plots can be used to better understand the distribution of errors beyond summary statistics. We can use either histograms or density plots to better understand the distribution of residual errors."
